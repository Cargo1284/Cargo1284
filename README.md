I am a senior at Columbia University studying computer science. I grew up in Long Branch, New Jersey. I am an avid sports fan and one of the biggest Yankee fans you'll ever meet. I have previously worked an internship and Prudential and will work their full time upon graduation. One of my goals is to work in the sports industry.
